# RFID-based-in-vehicle-road-sign-detection-system
The aim of the project is to build a RFID based system for infrastructure to vehicle communication, which can transmit the information provided by signals placed on the road. By active signals we
mean ordinary traffic signals that incorporate long-range active RFID tags with information storedbinto them. This information is collected in real time by RFID receiver and display on serial
monitor. Thus to improve the driving safety we are doing this project. Our hardware will alert the vehicle driver so that further mishaps would be avoided and traffic rules would be properly
implemented.
